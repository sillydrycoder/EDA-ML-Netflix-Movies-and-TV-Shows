## Practical Overview

 - **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
	 - Data Analysis
	 - Data Processing
	 - Data Visualization 
- **Model Training**
	- Features: 
		- `type , release_year, country, listed_in`
	- Target:
		- `rating`
	- Testing Volume: 20%
	- Training Volume: 80%

- **Machine Learning Models Implementation**
	 - SVM 	(Support Vector Machine)
	 - KNN 	(K-Nearest Neighbor)
	 - Linear Regression 	
	 - Decision Tree
- **Graphical Presentation**
	- SVM, KNN, Decision Tree Accuracy
	- Linear Regression (Actual vs. Predicted) 

## Libraries Uses:
